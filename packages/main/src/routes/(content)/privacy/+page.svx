# Privacy Policy

This is a simple testing app for Supabase authentication, created by David Hunt.

## What This App Does

This app is just for testing Supabase authentication features. It doesn't do anything else.

## What Information I Collect

Only what's needed for testing authentication:

- Your email address (if you sign up with email)
- Basic profile info, including name and avatar (if you use social login with Google or GitHub)

## How I Use Your Information

Your information is used only to allow you to sign in to the app, for testing purposes.

I don't:
- Share your info with anyone
- Use it for marketing
- Track your usage
- Sell your data
- Send you emails (other than automated emails for authentication workflows)

## Where Your Data Is Stored

Your information is stored in a Supabase database.

## Deleting Your Data

You can delete your account anytime, which removes all your information from the database.
